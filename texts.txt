this is a simple paragraph that
is meant to be nice and easy to type which is why
there will be mommas no periods or any capital letters so
i guess this means that it cannot really
be considered a paragraph but just a series of run on sentences
this should help you get faster at typing as
im trying not to use too many difficult words in it although
i think that i might
start making it hard by including some more difficult letters
I'm typing pretty quickly so forgive me for any mistakes
i think that i will not just tell you a story about the time
i went to the zoo and found a monkey and a fox
playing together they
a quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
